    <h1 className='text-center mb-48 mt-28' >About Us</h1>  
    <p className=" text-center">Inspired by my time living and working at some of finest dining establishments in Las Vegas, Nevada. <br /> Seven Sins Cocktail Co. is a labor of love and a child of my passion for mixology and culinary arts.</p>
    {/*<p className="text-center indent-4">Focused on simple formulas and using only all- natural ingredients, my vision is to never use any artficial flavors, colors, < br /> or preservatives in my products.</p>
    <h1 className="font-bold text-3xl">Meet the founder</h1>
    <p className="text-center">Hi I'm Dennis! I'm just a regular guy who can't seem to stop chasing big dreams. Born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, <br /> I spent appproximately 2 years of my early adult life living in Los Angeles, California to seek out new opportunities, <br/> and I found my way into the food and beverage industry. After that, I moved to Las Vegas, Nevada where I continued < br/>  my journey into the world of culinary arts. My most notable position  was held as a guest experience specialist at <br/>Vanderpump Cocktail Garden at Caesars Palace for none- other than the world famous TV reality star Lisa Vanderpump <br/> and her wonderful family, where I spent approximately 3 years in the role before deciding to find my way back to my <br/> roots and my home in Lincoln, Nebraska. </p><p className="text-center">Coming from humble beginnings, I was always taught to work hard and keep on fighting when the going gets tough, < br /> in my early years I struggled with homelessness, starvation, and mental health but it only forced me to become stronger, more disciplined, and more refined. My values of self- suffiency are burnt into my core and because of this. Along with my work experience and determination to teach myself new skills ant constantly reach new heights of personal achievement, this business has been built by myself alone. I developed all the products and recipes, and even coded the entire website (application) from scratch using javascript and Next JS with PostgresQl as my database for storing messages and eventually the data for user accounts if this business grows enough to merit that feature. </p>*/}
