As implied by the name, the Old Fashioned is a timeless classic. Traditionally, the Old Fashioned contains only 4 ingredients: whiskey, sugar(or simple syrup), bitters(typically Angostura aromatic), and ice. In this recipe I substitute the simple syrup for my <Link href='/product/blood-orange-cocktail-syrup'> Blood Orange Syrup. </Link>


## Ingredients:
- 2 ounce Bourbon Whiskey 
- 2-3 teaspoons <Link href="/product/blood-orange-cocktail-syrup"> Blood Orange Syrup </Link>
- 3-4 dashes Angostura bitters
- <Link href='/product/blood-orange'>Dehydrated Blood Orange or Cara Cara Brulee </Link>

## Steps:
1. Prepare your rocks glass by inserting an ice sphere or cube.
2. Combine all liquids into the rocks glass and stir until well mixed and diluted to your liking.
3. Garnish with a slice of blood orange.
