Originating at the Caribe Hilton in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Pina Colada is a  classic caribbean cocktail made with rum, pineapple juice, cream of coconut, and lime juice. This vibrant colored version doesnt deviate from the traditional recipes much besides the fact that we're using pink pineapple instead of the more common yellow variety. Also using a lightly filtered pineapple puree rather than juice adds a nice addional layer of texture and complexity to the drink! 


## Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 ounces Malibu Coconut Rum
- 1 1/2 ounces Pink Glow Pineapple puree (strained)
- 1 ounce coconut creme
- 1/2 ounce Lime Juice (fresh squeezed)
- Sliced strawberry(optional)

## Steps:
1. Prepare your glass by chilling a coupe glass or filling a highball with ice.
2. Combine all liquids into a shaker with ice.
3. Thouroughly mix all ingredients and strain into glass.
5. Garnish with a slice of stawberry on the rim.
