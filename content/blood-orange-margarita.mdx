The sidecar is a classic Cognac cocktail rumoured to have originated at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, France in the early 1920's. The recipe was first published in two books in 1922: 'Cocktails and How To Mix Them' by Robert Vermeire, and 'Harrys ABC of Mixing Cocktails' by Harry MacElhone. The orignal formula calls for equal parts Cognac, orange liqueur, and lemon juice. The drink evolved to call for two parts cognac, one part orange liqueur, and one part lemon juice. Traditionally, the sidecar is a sour/ dry cocktail, leaving the option for a sugar rim to balance out the flavors. The Sidepiece takes inspiration from more modern versions of the sidecar which typically use simple syrup and introduce other fruit flavors and bitters into the recipe. In this recipe we will be "doubling up" on the cognac by using Grand Marnier instead of Cointreau. The ratios remain the same but I also added 1oz of Spiced Pear Syrup, 2 tablespoons of Aquafaba (or 1 egg white), and 3 dashes of black walnut bitters which can be sprayed on top with an atomizer or mixed in according to your personal preferance.

- 2 ounces Tequila Blanco
