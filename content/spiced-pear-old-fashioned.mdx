As implied by the name, the Old Fashioned is a timeless classic. Traditionally, the Old Fashioned contains only 4 ingredients: whiskey, sugar(or simple syrup), bitters(typically Angostura aromatic), and ice. In this recipe I substitute the simple syrup for my <Link href='/coming-soon'> spiced pear syrup. </Link> This syrup is made with fresh D'Anjou pears and has notes of allspice, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, star anise, and vanilla bean.


## Ingredients:
- 2 ounce Bourbon Whiskey 
- 2-3 teaspoons <Link href="/coming-soon"> Spiced Pear Syrup </Link>
- 3-4 dashes Angostura bitters
- <Link href='/product/anjou-pear'>Dehydrated Pear </Link> and Star Anise

## Steps:
1. Prepare your rocks glass by inserting an ice sphere or cube.
2. Combine all liquids into the rocks glass and stir until well mixed and diluted to your liking.
3. Garnish with a slice of dehydrated pear and a star anise pod.
