The Moscow Mule is a classic combination of vodka, ginger beer, and lime. Traditionally it is served in a copper mug and garnished with a fresh lime and mint. Despite it's name, the Moscow Mule was actually invented in Los Angeles as a marketing ploy to get Americans to drink more vodka. At its core, the Moscow Mule is a buck, defined as a cocktail comprising of a spirit, lime juice, and ginger beer. Many variations of the mule have arisin since the advent of the Moscow Mule, with various fruit flavors being added to the mix. For this version, I have decided to incorporate my <Link href="/coming-soon">spiced pear syrup</Link>. This syrup is made with fresh D'Anjou pears and has notes of allspice, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, star anise, and vanilla bean. 


## Ingredients:
